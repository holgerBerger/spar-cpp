spar  Simple Parallel ARchiver



objectives

- simplicity
    - do not solve all archiving problems, but give users a fast tool
      to quickly move data over network and store it away for later use
    - concentrate on speed first
    - simple things first: create archives/extract archives
    - appending/removing files: may be never
    - not a backup tool! not for root, not for special files
    - ignore big endian for the moment, little endian 64bit only

- being fast on parallel filesystems, or network filesystems with high latency 
    - exploit parallelism of host machine, that means
        - parallel scanning of directory tree
        - parallel compression and checksumming
        - parallel writing in target archive
    - a parallel scanner and parallel reading of many files allows to hide  
      large network latencies, goal is to beat tar/cpio with cold caches by large factors.
    - write in parallel in large IOs to make good use of capabilities
      of parallel filesystems like lustre, beegfs or gpfs/spectrum scale.

- offer compression on file basis
    - the internal format could even choose different compression per block
    - offer extremly fast and good compression, snappy and zstd
    - offer crc to detect problems

- do not waste too much memory
    - file format allows parallel writing while not wasting memory,
      as files can be interleaved in archive (so small files can be
      interleaved with large files taking long to archive, which allows
      for fast archiving of a mix of small and large files)

- offer a streamable format 
    - sparcreate | ssh host sparextract -C dir
      should beat scp -r



usage

-c  create archive
    example:
        spar -c archive.spar dir1 dir2
-i  read file list from stdin
    example:
        find dir1 | spar -i -c archive.spar
-e  extract
    example:
        spar -e archive.spar
